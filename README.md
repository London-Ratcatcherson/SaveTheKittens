# saveTheKittens
Sample HTML5 - JavaScript interactive game

"Save the Kittens" is a variation of the Pokemon-Jay game, also in this repository. It's the same game, but with different audio, background images, player images and text for the html pages. 

This variant is a light political game.

See the Pokemon-Jay README.md for more details. 

Like Pokemon-Jay, the "Save the Kittens" game plays fine on desktops and tablets, but poorly on phones (right now).
